## Experience

So I encountered few crashes which dint affect my work. But there was one crash and my whole page disappeared on editor. I lost all work(75%) and informed on internshala chat 
Luckily there were backup folders but I could not get them back in atri file formats on editor so I made new folder and hosted the html files

I enjoyed using your framework but please do consider this problem that I faced. I have made a great clone but I could have done lot better and completed it. I become pretty comfortable with the engine and was able to solve various challenges 

Also I have left a easter egg on the website. The first link of blogs section takes you to a tutorial video I have created for ISTE VESIT ( tech society)

## Feedback
#### These are some feedback pointers which I can explain in detail if needed

**Improvements** - copy paste feature needs improvement, root directory can be left open, more intuitive drag n drop, value should not reset to px, value modification can be improved

**Feature ideas**- a floating sidebar can help for cloning n seeing actual screen ratio without publishing, increment scrolling , code to component conversion

**Major bugs**  - App crash atleast 3 times in 1 hr, All my work vanished due to a crash, template adder has major bugs, svg component did not work
